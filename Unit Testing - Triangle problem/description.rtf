Consider a program like the following: The program reads the values of three variables. These values represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The idea of the program is that it tells its user, based on the lengths of the sides entered, whether the triangle is equilateral (all three pages are the same length), isosceles (two sides are the same length - the third side is different in length than the others), or irregular (all sides have different lengths). How would you test it?\cb1 \
\cb3 Write the program and tests using Python -write at least three test cases - 1 for all three different triangles.}
